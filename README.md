# AmpVarPro
# ONT Amplicon Sequencing Variant Calling Pipeline
# Overview
This repository contains a variant calling pipeline tailored for amplicon sequencing data generated using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). It automates the process from raw reads to annotated variants, facilitating rapid analysis of genetic variants. The pipeline integrates several bioinformatics tools, including minimap2 for mapping reads to a reference genome, samtools for processing BAM files, fastp for read quality filtering, and Clair3 for variant calling. Variants are annotated using snpEff.

# Prerequisites

Python 3.x

minimap2

samtools

fastp

Clair3 (and its dependencies)

snpEff

# Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ont-amplicon-variant-calling.git

cd ont-amplicon-variant-calling

Install dependencies:

Most dependencies can be installed via conda or bioconda channels. It is recommended to create a new conda environment.

##### conda create -n ont-vc python=3.8 minimap2 samtools fastp snpEff -c bioconda

##### conda activate ont-vc

#### Follow the installation instructions of Clair3 from its official GitHub repository.

# Usage
Prepare your environment:

Before running the pipeline, make sure all dependencies are installed and your environment is activated.

# Run the pipeline:

The pipeline is executed through a Python script that requires several arguments, including paths to input files and directories, reference genome, and quality filtering parameters.

##### AmpVarPro.py --input_directory /path/to/input --min_length 100 --max_length 1500 --threads 8 --reference_genome /path/to/ref.fasta --phred_quality 20 --snpeff_data /path/to/snpeff/data --model /path/to/model

Replace the placeholder paths and parameters with your actual data and desired settings.

Example

Assuming you have a directory named data containing subdirectories for each barcode (e.g., barcode01, barcode02, ...), a reference genome file ref.fasta, and the necessary snpeff data and model files:

##### python AmpVarPro.py --input_directory ./data --min_length 100 --max_length 1500 --threads 4 --reference_genome ./ref.fasta --phred_quality 20 --snpeff_data ./snpeff/data --model ./clair/model

This command will process each barcode directory in parallel, perform variant calling, and output annotated variants.
